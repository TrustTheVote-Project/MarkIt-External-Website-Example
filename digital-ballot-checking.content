    <p>Before you've finished using the mobile voter app, please save
    the ballot tracking code. You can use it to ensure that your
    returned ballot was received and to track the processing of your
    ballot. It's as simple as typing the first few characters of your
    ballot tracking code into a web form at TrackMyBallot.org. </p>
